# -Linear-Regression-model-Fish-Weight

### Specifications
* By using Linear Regression model
* Study of Fish Data for prediction of their weight
* In this project I have worked on Fish Data for predicting that what will be the weight of Fish by various variables.
* Weight of Fish is Numerical, hence I applied Linear Regression.
* I worked on this data to find out what are factors affecting the weight of Fish.
